<h1>Expenses Tracker</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
A web application that allows you to add all your expenses, monitor and track them, and categorize them depending on the year.</br>
It includes a chart that shows your costs in each month of the selected year depending on the amount of each item's cost.</br> 
- Each bar in chart --> [sum Of All Expense In Month / Max Expense In Selected Year]</br>
Update: all of your added expenses will be stored using local storage, so if you refresh the page all of them will be stored ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<h2>Why did I build it ?</h2>
<p>
I built it to help me understand ReactJS [mix of HTML and JavaScript, widely known as JSX].</br>
Help me understand many concepts like useState hook, two-way Binding, and others.
